## Guidelines

### Versions
When submitting changes, please ensure the version number is updated in the following files:
* `README.md`
* `package.json`
* `package-lock.json`

Only change the last two numbers (`1.x.x`) if it is not a major update (e.g., a bug fix or minor feature addition).  
If it is a major update (significant changes or breaking changes), you may update the first number (`x.0.0`).

A version number cannot go higher than `9`. For example:
* If the current version is `1.0.9`, the next version should be `1.1.0`.
